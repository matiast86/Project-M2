      <p>This project is part of Module 2 of the Full Stack Development program at <strong>Soy Henry</strong>.
        Throughout this module, I have worked on 14 assignments (Homeworks) that have allowed me to develop and
        consolidate my programming skills. Each assignment addresses different aspects and fundamental technologies for
        a Full Stack developer.</p>
